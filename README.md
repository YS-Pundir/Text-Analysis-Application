## 🚀 What This Project Does

- Accepts text via direct user input or `.txt` files
- Computes key text statistics:
  - Character count (with and without spaces)
  - Word count (punctuation-aware)
  - Sentence and paragraph count
- Performs unique word frequency analysis
- Displays the **Top 10 most frequent words**
- Visualizes results using bar charts with Matplotlib

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **Matplotlib**
- File I/O
- Lists & Dictionaries
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

---

## 🧩 Design & Implementation

This project is implemented in two styles:
